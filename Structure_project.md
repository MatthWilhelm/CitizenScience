### CoSoSa: Community-driven Soil Sampling

- Steps for the project (table of content)

  - Describe in some details the research questions and what kind of data is needed to answer those questions.
    - Comparison between cultivated (across various cultural practices) and wild soils in terms of biodiversity, ecosystemic services etc.
    - Detection of some resistances to fungicides and advances in the mecanisms of development of fungal resistances
    - Storage in the Mycothèque of the interesting strains
    - Addition to a public data base of all interesting sequences
  - Building a core community for gathering samples from two distinct sources: *Environment* and *Agriculture*
    - *Environment*. Schools will get those samples. As an incentive, we will develop pedagogical material to be provided to teachers who would participate in the action (sending petri dishes for conducting experiments). 
    - *Agriculture*. Using association such as Prométerre/Agridea or similar, we could try to reach a large number of participants to get involved. 
  - Co-creating with the core communities the specifications a mobile app' to allow citizen to get involved
  - Develop an adequate sampling design for the entire Canton
  - Develop a long-term storage strategy for the samples
  - Engage citizen in the sample collection, based on the past experiences and developping a particular concept for this project
  - getting the sampling done
  - analyze the results and publish them. Answer the scientific questions at hand. 
  - Store, archive the samples
  - Give a follow-up to participants

- Options for getting funding (not mutually exclusive)
  - [The Mercator Stiftung Switzerland](https://www.stiftung-mercator.ch/) pourrait éventuellement financer une partie du projet. C'est une piste intéressante. Elle a été crée par la famille [Schmidt-Ruthenbeck](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmidt-Ruthenbeck). 
  - InnoSuisse grant
  - Joint Cantonal Project: mixing department of agriculture and public instruction of Canton e Vaud through an appropriate funding scheme

- Potential partners
  - Liip
  - Société Vaudoise de Sciences Naturelles
