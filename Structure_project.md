### Table of content of a citizen science project to monitor soil microbiome and fungal biodiversity

- Steps for the project

  - Describe in some details the research questions and what kind of data is needed to answer those questions.
    - Comparison between cultivated (across various cultural practices) and wild soils in terms of biodiversity, ecosystemic services etc.
    - Detection of some resistances to fungicides and advances in the mecanisms of development of fungal resistances
    - Storage in the Mycothèque of the interesting strains
    - Addition to a public data base of all interesting sequences
  - Building a core community for gathering samples from two distinct sources: *Environment* and *Agriculture*
    - *Environment*. Schools will get those samples. As an incentive, we will develop pedagogical material to be provided to teachers who would participate in the action (sending petri dishes for conducting experiments). 
    - *Agriculture*. Using association such as Prométerre/Agridea or similar, we could try to reach a large number of participants to get involved. 
  - Co-creating with the core communities the specifications a mobile app' to allow citizen to get involved
  - Develop an adequate sampling design for the entire Canton
  - Develop a storage strategy
  - Engage citizen in the sample collection, based on the past experiences
  - getting the sampling done
  - analyze the results and publish them. Answer the scientific questions at hand. 
  - Store, archive the samples
  - Give a follow-up to participants
